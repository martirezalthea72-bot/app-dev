# Stranger Things

**Stranger Things** is my favorite series. It is a mix of *sci-fi*, *horror*, and *mystery* set in the 1980s. The story follows a group of kids who uncover strange events happening in their small town, Hawkins.

## Why I Like It
- The characters are brave and loyal.  
- It has a mysterious and nostalgic 80s vibe.
- The story shows the power of friendship and courage.
